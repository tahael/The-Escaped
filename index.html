		<div class="article_title">The Audacity of Deceit</div>
		<div id="article1" class="summary">
		    <p>Images, especially the ones you see as a kid, can shape your views forever. I was about 2 years old when my family decided it was time for my circumcision. In all Muslim families, the event is an occasion for celebration. Gifts are brought to the little kid, who is dressed in traditional clothing for the occasion. I remember loving my Jellaba (Moroccan traditional outfit), so much that I compared it to the one of a man whose portrait was hanging on the hospital's walls. This was nearly the same picture hanging in my father's office, my kindergarten's playground and every single shop my parents got me into. That day, I proudly looked at the picture and shouted: "My Jellaba is nicer than his!" Eyes started to roll, people looked away and my mother gave me a look similar to the one she gave when I spilled something on the floor. Only two years old, I already had it in me. And I had no idea that the man I compared myself to was Hassan II, then King of Morocco, Commander of the Faithful, Head of Government, Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Head of the Judiciary and founder of modern Morocco as we know it. Did I mention I was only two?</p>
		    <p>You do not have much of a choice when the two TV channels and handful of radios and newspapers you are exposed to are all state-run. Not surprisingly, you quickly end up believing that what those media outlets tell you is the absolute, non-refutable truth. Until the late 1980s - when satellite dishes were introduced to the country - Morocco was such an environment. Like most Moroccans, I grew up fiercely believing in one of those "absolute truths": the Monarchy, illustrated in the person of the Monarch, is (and should be) an omniscient force, with a hand in every single aspect of our lives as Moroccans. No wonder. The first thing National TV broadcast was "Royal Activities". Same thing for newspaper headlines. The principle of Freedom of Speech, guaranteeing diversity in Media sources, was not well understood, let alone institutionalized. There was no equivalent of the "First Amendment" upon which citizens could claim their right to free expression in court. There was, on the other hand, Article 23: "The person of the King shall be sacred and inviolable." Now that I am 23, I never thought that the latter article would be used by many segments of the Moroccan society as an impediment to the democratic reforms Moroccans have been longing for decades ago.</p>
		    <p>You gotta love the Arab Spring of 2011. Not only for the overthrow of abusive leaders, but for the paradigm shift it created in the minds of Arabs, citizens and elites alike. Three weeks after the notorious demonstrations of February 20th, the Moroccan monarchy took matters into its own hands in what many have considered as a very clever move. And a clever move it was. Because it has spared Morocco the many losses in lives and property that others had to go through in order to live with dignity. Although insufficient to the many liberal dreamers out there, the institutional amendments proposed by Mohammed VI comprised all the necessary prerequisites for a representative government and an independent judiciary. A council of way too familiar faces was appointed (not elected) to discuss and put amendments on the ballot... And then for three months, I saw the worst of my countrymen.</p>
		    <p>One of my best sources for understanding human behavior is ancient Greek literature, most probably because it rationalizes it to an infinite level. I once read in my philosophy class that the Greek skeptics could identify three major motives for any human action: fear, pride and interest. And it was clear to anyone that mostly interest guided the reaction of Moroccan society to the Royal proposal. In an all too familiar move, politicians, union leaders, bureaucrats, media outlets, businessmen and - my favorite (see image below) - religious figures all mobilized themselves to introduce the upcoming referendum as either a confirmation of the Monarchy or a challenge to it. This was to me the ultimate insult to the intelligence of Moroccans, people who struggle everyday to make a living, and thus should seriously try to figure out the effect of any reform on their socio-economic well-being. Instead, the average fella was led to believe that above any consideration, the referendum was a sovereign exercise in which their loyalty to the King and (yes) to God is put to the test. And only then, you could count on the other behavioral motive to do the job for you: fear. So instead of looking forward to improvements, the citizenry would just be concerned of not losing whatever the status quo "guaranteed". Fear was certainly present among the elites as well, who were afraid to lose whatever advantages they had acquired in society. Because if you think of public administration as a way of obtaining necessary social services, many Moroccan bureaucrats view it as a cash cow. If you watch RTM or 2M to get informed, you will either get indoctrinated or entertained (respectively). Also unless you are willing to share your wealth with the system, your business will have a hard time taking off. And I am not talking about paying taxes. </p>
		    <p>These were supposed to be the real stakes of the referendum. No matter the content of the proposed amendments, opinion-makers were supposed to openly debate the role of institutions [Parliament, Executive, Judiciary - and yes - the Monarchy] in checking each other's functioning for one purpose and one purpose only: making things better for the little guy. Alas, the little guy went happy to the ballot on a sunny Friday, not knowing what they were really voting for. The result: an electoral rampage of gigantic proportions which defies all laws of physics, philosophy, sociology, politics or even statistics. More than 98 percent majority? You cannot possibly convince me that Moroccan society lacks diversity that much.</p>
		    <p>Moroccans love their King. They love their religion. They also love their food, their weddings and their traditions. So many cultural symbols that make this country unique. And it is because they are distinctive that cultural and sovereign symbols should not be used in political debate. Regardless of the future improvements that the new Constitution may bring, I think we have missed out on a priceless opportunity to initiate ourselves to civic debate. I hope that next time they go to the ballots, most Moroccans will know what they are voting for. Otherwise, Churchill would have been right when saying: "The best argument against Democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter." </p>

		<div class="article_title">THE WAY TO A PEACEFUL RECONQUEST OF PALESTINE</div>
		<div id="article2" class="summary">
		    <p>Often emotions get in the way of reason. The Israeli-Palestinian issue is no different in this regard. The Arabs see the Israelis as occupiers of Palestinian (and most importantly Muslim) lands and dream of reconquest while the Jewish settlers see their presence as a divinely mandated mission to regain the holy lands and a fulfillment of prophecies as old as human history. The emotional loads on both sides pushed the possibilities of settlement towards the limits of the possible to flirt with the pure impossible. These loads developed and morphed over the years. The history of how the problem was perceived through the 20th century reveals spectacular changes. These changes, however, only resulted in more violence. With these variables at play, our imagination can venture into new unexplored paradigms for a feasible solution only if we step out of the emotional bubble that blurs our judgment. Such a bold step opens the doors for new possibilities of which the most attractive seems to be no other than the usual suspect: compromise.</p>
		    <p>It could be argued that the two parties spent the last century looking for the right amount of compromise which is true except both were looking for an emotionally comforting compromise that gives them a triumphant position in a zero sum game. If emotions are to be taken out of the game, another type of compromise could be achieved. The Jewish settlers succeeded in creating a De Facto situation that makes it nearly impossible for Palestinians and sympathizing Arabs and Muslims to realize their dream of feeding the Jews to the Mediterranean fish. On the other hand, the Palestinians proved the hardest of species to exterminate. It could be argued that the continuous extermination attempts led by Jewish settlers were the source of the Palestinians’ two most powerful weapons: fertility and the absence of a state. These two weapons if used properly could lead to a historical triumph for both parties: one in the short run, the other in the long run. If Palestinians let go of the emotional loads from the past century considering it a sunk cost, which is probably the central and most challenging step on the way to triumph, a feasible solution with tremendously positive outcomes in the long run would be to integrate into the state of Israel. At first, the idea sounds radical and simply crazy but if emotions are carefully insulated, it looks more sensible. Such a decision would provide both parties with the triumph they crave. For “Israel” would have fulfilled its mission in the holy lands while Palestinians would have reconquested the entirety of “Palestine” with minimum bloodshed, if any. It is obvious that simply renouncing to the current emotionally charged and practically unfeasible solutions would not do the job. Palestinians need to integrate the Israeli society as legitimate citizens. Becoming citizens of Israel is not the end but the beginning; the beginning of a long fight for equality within the Israeli society. A fight that is bigger than the struggle that brought down the Berlin wall or the Apartheid. Once the Muslim and Christian subjects of Israel become equal citizens with their Jewish compatriots, it will be time for the delayed gratification of the triumph of Palestine. At that time, the second most dangerous weapon (i.e. fertility) would come handy. Currently the Muslims and Christians in the area (including refugees) outnumber the Jewish. With the high fertility rate of Muslims and Christians the imbalance is ensured to persist well into the future. As Muslims and Christians become a Majority in Israel, the “Jewish” state would make no sense. The imbalance will eventually result in the modification of the racist constitution and institutions that favor subjects based on their religion. In the long run, the result would inevitably be a secular democratic state where the three religions peacefully coexist.</p>
		    <p> It would be naïve to assume that the road towards such a state would be rosy but there are bumps on the road to the creation of any great nation.</p>

		<div class="article_title">Why I Almost Voted for the Islamists</div>
		<div id="article3" class="summary">
		    <p>My country’s constitution grants me secrecy of content in my electoral choices. But in an era of open information, Internet-triggered revolutions and popular uprisings, it is near impossible to fake one’s stand on fundamental matters. My generation’s increasing need for genuine and authentic politics is consistent with my need for a clearer view of the world around me. Neither you nor I should have to justify why we think or believe the way we do. But today, I feel it’s time to make an exception.</p>
		    <p>The reason I say “almost” is because I was out of my hometown. Had that not been the case, I am certain that I would have gone to the voting booth, double-crossed the lantern sign (referring to the Justice and Development Party) and put it in the ballot with a big smile on my face. “What?”</p>
		    <p> 
		    I would hardly come across as a religious person, let alone an Islamist. I drink (diet) Coke, listen to U2, wear jeans and hang out wearing iPod earbuds. My favourite outfit of all times are the 1960s suits the Execs wear on “Mad Men”. I went to College in a Liberal Arts University, where I decided from the beginning to wipe out my mind clean of anything the Moroccan education system had taught me (except the Math, of course). Before turning 20, I was taught the very enjoyable art of critical thinking and research. Through literature, I was introduced to Socrates, Plato, Rousseau, Hemingway, Lincoln, Churchill, Kant, Nietzsche, Adam Smith, Marx, Fisher, Weber, Hume, Kotler, Sartre… Nice bunch. They did things to my mind. Most importantly, they made me realize that Truth cannot be found only in one place: not only in religion, not only in science, not only on CNN, not only on Aljazeera, and most certainly not on RTM or 2M. While finding out things, scepticism was my method. While thinking of the world around me, I envisioned a life of knowledge, virtue, cooperation and progress. At 22, I turned out to be a hard-core leftist Liberal. Needless to say, I despised anything the Islamists had to say. Yet I was not aware that the way I viewed them was the function of many variables, ranging from the US State Department, to Telquel Magazine’s flaming prose, to the Moroccan Ministry of Interior’s mass imprisonment of anyone Bin Ladinish… It was inconceivable to me and many of my peers that a political movement based on religion would last that long. Meanwhile, PJD was not only surviving every blow, but getting stronger and stronger.</p>
		    <p> 
		    In 2007, a bald nerd-looking career bureaucrat named Fouad Ali El Himma “resigned” from his post as Moroccan Interior Minister after a life of faithful public service within the most powerful and significant Moroccan institution. Primary-Secondary-High School-College buddies with Mohammed VI, this guy had the brilliant idea to get into politics, the very field he was tasked to watch, censor and control when he was at the Mother of all Ministries. The effect was like the Big Bang. With a bunch of comrades from his constituency of Rhamna, El Himma founded a miniature political party to get elected to Parliament. Then, he started raffling MPs from other parties, who were more than excited to leave their parties and be partners with the King’s friend (After all, a man’s gotta look after himself, right?). Together, they founded the Movement for All Democrats, to be later named the Party for Authenticity and Modernity (PAM). During the late 2000s, PAM was the trend of the day. Everybody wanted in, and they could easily get in. The “party” functioned like the tractor that was its symbol: it established a powerful base of educated young executives and won the subsequent regional elections of 2009 in an unprecedented landslide. Intellectuals, opinion-makers and businessmen admired and supported it for its corporate-like management, focused on results and efficiency. The political sphere, on the other hand, had every reason to attack it. PAM was confusing a political arena that was already turned upside down. In a country where it is rare to find a political party with a discernable political ideology, there was no telling what El Himma’s bunch stood for. You could not tell whether they were conservative or liberal, whether they were for a welfare state or a market-oriented style of government, whether they were for the extension of civil liberties or not… You could not, in other words, place PAM in a political spectrum. Its leadership liked to retort that it was there to “serve the country”, unaware that there were different ideas on how to do so. It was, to sum up, a gathering of technocrats disguised as militants. Moroccans unfortunately allowed themselves to get fooled by that impression for 2 years. But then something happened.</p>
		    <p>
		    Wikileaks exposed the causes of the Middle East’s misery. El Bouaazizi burned himself. Ben Ali left. Mubarak left. Kaddafi was killed. We all know the story. When Middle Easterns were given the opportunity to freely express their will, one trend was common to all. Islamist parties flourished. The pattern was too obvious to be rendered insignificant. From Hamas to Ennahda to the Muslim Brotherhood, it looked like Islamists did not even need to campaign in order to take over government. The treachery was evident: the only reason Islamists were always in the opposition was that the regimes within which they were operating employed repression and ballot-rigging. There was then no need to wonder why the US, France or Britain were fond of people like Ben Ali, Kaddafi or Mubarak. And then it hit me. If Islamists were that bad, why on earth were they so popular?</p>
		    <p> 
		    It did not take me much to understand that if you take out the strictly spiritual component of their discourse, Islamists are not that different from leftists. They both fight for social justice and equal opportunity. And in case you are tempted to bring out the inheritance issue, I challenge any Moroccan “secular” out there to campaign on the basis of equal inheritance for both genders. Journalists will root for it, Intellectuals will defend it. But no politician is suicidal enough to adopt it. Moroccan Islamists also appear to encourage women more than other parties. In fact, in the current government, they were the only ones to nominate a female minister. Secular much? But then you would tell me, you do have Socialists in Morocco, don’t you? Yes. They had their chance. And they failed miserably, probably because of the numerous temptations that officeholders are faced with.</p>
		    <p>Yet one thing fascinates me the most about Islamists in my country. They have a deeply rooted aversion for corruption, nepotism and clientelism, the very sources of immobilism in Morocco. You see it in their conventions and the way they choose their leadership. No Fassi Fihri-like family appointments. Islamists make this a matter of life and death. And if religion is the source of their opposition to it, it’s good enough for me.
		    I know what you’re thinking. Yes, the value system of Islamists is anything but progressive. But which country are we talking about? Isn’t it the one that constitutionally defines itself as a Muslim Kingdom under the guidance of the Commander of the Faithful? Isn’t it the one where if you are dating someone, a policeman is still required by law to ask for your papers in order to check whether you are married? Isn’t it the one where magazines are fined for publishing religious jokes? If this is the Morocco you are talking about, then the ethical tendencies of Islamists should be the least of your worries.</p>
		    <p>
		    Everybody saw it coming. Morocco was no exception to the rule. The hilarious part of Morocco’s 2011 General Elections was that eight parties had to team up in order to counter the Islamist influence. Not two. Not four. Eight. It tells a lot about who you are when your only aim is to stop someone instead of promoting what you believe in. The so-called “G8” was literally composed of the bulk of the Moroccan old guard, former ministers, MPs and bureaucrats who had a hard time understanding the concept of retirement. Not surprisingly, PAM was part of it, along with other regime-engineered political entities. This time, however, Moroccans sent a loud and clear message: Get Out.</p>
		    <p>
		    I particularly admired the way the Monarchy handled the Islamist victory. PJD’s Number 1 was swiftly appointed Prime Minister. El Himma was taken out of Politics and put back where he has always belonged: at the service of His Majesty. More importantly, life went on. No bars were closed, no clubs were ripped of their booze. And girls still went outside heads uncovered, with their Zara jeans and Louboutin high heels. Just how I like’em. The Islamist phobia seemed like a nightmare during a bad night’s sleep, mostly insignificant.</p>
		    <p>The most successful political movements have always been the ones able to capture and absorb popular outcry, then translate it in institutions through legislation. Ask Ghandi. Ask Clinton. Ask Erdugan. Ask Obama (you all saw that one coming, didn’t you?). Ask Hania in Palestine. The Justice and Development Party has fulfilled the first criterion of a successful political movement. And while it strives to fulfil the second, it does deserve respect and consideration.</p>

		<div id="article4" class="summary">
		    <p>Around the time of Fog Creek Software's ten year anniversary, I started thinking that if we want to keep our employees excited and motivated for another ten years, we were going to need some new things to work on. It occurred to me that we could easily afford to make four little two-person teams to launch four new products. That would give our developers more chances to move around from product to product when they got bored, which would make Fog Creek Software an even better place to work.</p>
		    <p>
		    Each team, we decided, would be guided by the spirit of lean startups. They would ship early and often. They would listen to real-world customers instead of building things in an ivory tower. And they wouldn't be afraid to pivot endlessly until they made something that people wanted.</p>
		    <p>
		    Next, we needed some business ideas. After ten years in management I still never knew what anyone was supposed to be working on. Once in a while I would walk around asking everyone what they were doing, and half the time, my reaction was "why the hell are you working on THAT?" So one of the teams started working on finding better ways to keep track of who was working on what. It had to be super simple and friction-free so that everyone would use it, but it had to be powerful, too.</p>
		    <p>
		    We had an early idea called FIVE THINGS. Everybody would have a list of exactly five things that they were allowed to work on. The top two were things they were actively doing right now. The other three were things that they would do as soon as they finished the first two. But nobody was ever allowed to have SIX things assigned to them. If you have too many things on your to-do list, your motivation tends to sag.</p>
		    <p>
		    Five Things wasn't the right idea, but it led us to the idea that became Trello. Pretty soon we had four programmers and two summer interns working on it. We started dogfooding the product when it was only 700 lines of code, and even in that super-simple form, we found it incredibly useful. By the end of the summer we realized we had a hit on our hands: an incredibly simple, easy-to-understand way for teams to collaborate online.</p>

		<div class="article_title">Justifying the price</div>
		<div id="article5" class="summary">
		    <p>I love to study how people make decisions about the things they buy and sell. It’s always fascinated me. Sometimes I go shopping not to buy, but to learn. I like to observe how people make purchasing (and selling) decisions.</p>
		    <p>
		    I guess that’s why my two favorite shows on TV are Pawn Stars and the ever entertaining Shark Tank. I’ve seen every episode of both and always look forward to the new ones.</p>
		    <p>
		    One thing I find interesting about Pawn Stars is how people justify selling their goods for less than they originally expected.</p>
		    <p>
		    After the pawn shop gives the seller their final buy offer, the seller – almost like clockwork – stares at something for a second, then comes up with a story like… “Well, my wife would kill me if I brought this home without selling it, so…” or “Well, I’m really running low on space in the garage, so…” or “Well, I’ve had this at the top of my closet for 20 years, so…”</p>
		    <p>
		    The pawn shop makes an offer, but the seller is the one who talks themselves into taking a low number. They justify the low price with the personal consequences of a non-sale. I guess it’s not all that different from justifying a buy, but there’s something fascinating about how people often need to give themselves a comforting non-monetary reason to give up something for less than they think it’s worth. Sometimes it’s “I need the money,” but more often than not it’s about this condition they’ll find themselves in if they don’t sell it.</p>
		    <p>
		    I don’t have much else to say about it other than I find it interesting that so many different people from so many different walks of life with so many different items for sale almost always fall into the same pattern of thinking. That itself is worth thinking about.</p>
